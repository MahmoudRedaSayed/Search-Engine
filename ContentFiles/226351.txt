[, , c is a procedural programming language. it was initially developed by dennis ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system. the main features of c language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make c language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development., , recent articles on c ! c

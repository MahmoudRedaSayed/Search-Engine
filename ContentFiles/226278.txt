[, data structure and algorithms course practice problems on hashing, hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, values into the hash table by using a hash function. it is done for faster access to elements. the efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used., let a hash function h(x) maps the value at the index x%10 in an array. for example if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or hash table respectively., , topic :, basics :, easy :, intermediate :, hard :, misc :, quick links :, if you like

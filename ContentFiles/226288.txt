[, data structure and algorithms course practice problems on matrix, a matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. it is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets., a matrix with 9 elements is shown below. this matrix [m] has 3 rows and 3 columns. each element of matrix [m] can be referred to by its row and column number. for example, a23 = 6., quick links :, if you like geeksforgeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org. see your article

the operating system used (for example.&& android or ios).&& the hostname of the accessing device (ip address) and the time of the server request are processed..&& due to the way the internet functions.&& the brief saving of the ip address is technically necessary. the ip addresses are deleted or anonymized after the processing. in case of anonymization.&& the ip addresses are changed in

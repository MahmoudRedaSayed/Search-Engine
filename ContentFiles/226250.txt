[, data structure and algorithms course practice problems on linked list recent articles on linked list, a linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. the elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:, in simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list., topics :, singly linked list :, more >>, circular linked list :, more >>, doubly linked list :, more >>, misc :, quick links :, if you still need more assistance with your placement preparation, have a look at our complete interview preparation course. the course has been designed by our expert mentors to help students crack the coding interview of top product or service-based organizations . you get access to premium lectures, 200+ coding questions bank, resume building tips, and lifetime access to the course content. so to make sure that your next programming interview doesn’t feel like an interrogation, enroll in complete interview preparation and give a boost to your placement preparation., please write comments if you find anything

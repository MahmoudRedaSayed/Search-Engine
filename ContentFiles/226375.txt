directly to our html file by writing the code inside the <script> tag. the <script> tag can either be placed inside the <head> or the <body> tag according to the requirement., external js: we can write javascript code in other file having an extension .js and then link this file inside the <head> tag of the html file in which we want to add this code., javascript is not only used for creating web pages but also creates millions of well-paid jobs all around the globe. save your valuable time by enroling in this fork javascript -self paced course . in this course, learn the basics concepts of javascript like- functions & arrays in javascript, working of js engines, and much more., once you are done strengthening your foundational skills with this course, it is recommended for you to start learning advanced javascript-self paced course and start your javascript programming journey today!., websites: javascript helps us to add behavior of our website. it helps users to interact with the website. for eg. clicking on buttons, saving details, uploading details on the website, etc., web servers: we can make robust server applications using javascript. to be precise we use javascript frameworks like node.js and express.js to build these servers., game development: in game development industry, javascript is used widely. with the addition of html5 canvas, it’s now possible to make 2d and 3d games in javascript very efficiently., 3d drawings: javascript in addition with html canvas is used to make three-dimensional graphics., mobile apps: mobile applications are the most popular modes of communicating these days. javascript also used to design mobile applications. there are many javascript frameworks using which we can make android, ios, and hybrid apps., smartwatch apps: the popular smartwatch maker pebble has created pebble.js, a small javascript framework that allows a developer to create an application for the pebble line of watches in javascript., no need of compilers: since javascript is an interpreted language, therefore it does not need any compiler for compilations., used both client and server-side: earlier javascript was used to build client-side applications only, but with the evolution of its frameworks namely node.js and express.js, it is now widely used for building server-side applications too., helps to build a complete solution: as we saw, javascript is widely used in both client and server-side applications, therefore it helps us to build an end-to-end solution to a given problem., used everywhere: javascript is so loved because it can be used anywhere. it can be used to develop websites, games or mobile apps, etc., huge community support: javascript has a huge community of users and mentors who love this language and take it’s legacy forward., introduction to javascript, where to put javascript code in an html document ?, introduction to javascript course, introduction to object oriented programming
